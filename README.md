# TS SPA
Just trying to understand how a SPA works. Nothing is optimized and I am sure there will be memory leaks but good enough to understand a few concepts.  

## I have implemented the following
1. How to set route + Page creation  
2. binding (only simple key values,no nested items)  
3. Dependency injection 

A few lifecycle events are also available  

Check the **doc** folder

## Files and Folders
Entry point is the **main.ts** file  
The main SPA files are in the **core** folder  
The **services** and **pages** folder just show an example  

### Core
* Under *core/common/global.app.ts* contains a singleton that manages the entire app.


## To run
```
npm run start
```
