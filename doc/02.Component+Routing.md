# Components and Routing

## Routing From Template
Use data-router attribute. In case of an Anchor tag you can just set the data-router attribute, the path will be fetched from href. For other elements the path must be assigned to data-router.

```
<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary"  data-router="/">Back</button>  

<a href='/' data-router>Go Back</a>
```
