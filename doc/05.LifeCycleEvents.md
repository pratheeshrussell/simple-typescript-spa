# LifeCycle Events
The following LifeCycle events are available. Interfaces are available for all events, though you need not explicitly implement them.

## onInit: 
Will be run as soon as the class is initialized. Even before the template is rendered. You may implement the **onInit** interface.
```
onInit(){
        console.log('Page initialized');
}
```

## AfterInit:
Will be run as soon as the template is rendered. You may implement the **AfterInit** interface.
```
AfterInit(){
        console.log('Template rendered');
}
```

## onDestroy:
Will be run just before the page is changed. You may implement the **onDestroy** interface.
```
onDestroy(): void {
        console.log('Page will be destroyed soon');
}
```

## onChangeDetected:
Will be run each time a **bindProps** value changes. You may implement the **onChangeDetected** interface.
```
onChangeDetected(key:string, value:any, newValue: any){
        console.log('onChangeDetected');
        console.log(key, ' is being changed from ' ,value, ' to ', newValue);
}
```
