# Service Injections

To inject a service. There are 2 steps

## Add in MainConfig decorator
Add your services to the **services** array. The app will instantiate it.

```
@MainConfig({
    rootElement:'app',
    routes: AppRoutes,
    services:[DataService]
})
```

## Add the inject decorator to Page constructor
@inject(SERVICE-NAME) followed by the parameter. Just note the **private** access modifier.

```
constructor(@inject('DataService') private dataservice:DataService){}
```

   
    
**NOTE** As of now Services cannot have injected services.That might be a simpler task but I will leave it at this.
